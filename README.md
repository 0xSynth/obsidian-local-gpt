# Local GPT plugin for Obsidian

![demo](https://github.com/pfrankov/obsidian-local-gpt/assets/584632/7618bed7-57e4-417e-82e4-5172fba1995b)

Local GPT assistance for maximum privacy and offline access.  
The plugin allows you to open a context menu on selected text to pick an AI-assistant's action.

Default actions:
- Continue writing
- Summarize text
- Fix spelling and grammar
- Find action items in text
- General help (just use selected text as a prompt for any purpose)

You can also add yours:

>**Limitations:**
>- Since plugin uses [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) it depends on it. The main limitation is "Windows coming soon".
>- No mobile support.

## Roadmap
- [x] Ability to select models from the list instead of typing their names
- [ ] Ability to share and apply presets (system prompt + prompt + model)
- [ ] Additional AI providers (OpenAI, etc...)
- [ ] Changing order of the prompts
- [ ] Accounting your local documents in results as described here https://ollama.ai/blog/llms-in-obsidian

## Other AI providers
If you would like to use other providers, please let me know [in the discussions](https://github.com/pfrankov/obsidian-local-gpt/discussions/1).

## My other Obsidian plugins
- [Colored Tags](https://github.com/pfrankov/obsidian-colored-tags) that colorizes tags in distinguishable colors.
